Daniel's Workflow Tips
	- OS part
		- Mac you're mostly setup for rest of video (Mac is Unix already)
		- Windows then you probably want to install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
			- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
			- Once you are using WSL, make sure to follow Linux instructions for online docs
		- Might want to get a better terminal if you are on Windows
			https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/get-started
	- SSH (logging into things)
		- SSH Keys
			Setup - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-ubuntu-20-04
			
			ssh -i ~/.ssh/SEASnet classaad@lnxsrv10.seas.ucla.edu
			
			Config File - https://linuxize.com/post/using-the-ssh-config-file/
			Note:	If you setup your SSH Key with a password, will have to use it each time
				but you can setup SSH Key without password
	- Git
		- Setup SSH Keys for password-less push/pull to Github
			Same setup as above, just need to add SSH Key to Github account
		- Use git to sync files from computer to server
			- Same repo on computer/server
	- Text Editors
		- Some prefer IDEs (Visual Studio/xCode/jetBrains)
		- Some prefer plainer (Sublime/Atom/Notepad++)
		- VSCode has useful features
			- Can connect over SSH for various features
			- Remote-SSH Extension
			- Remote-WSL Extension (if using WSL)
			- Good to setup SSH Keys + Config so you can connect to predefined servers without password
			
			For some reason, VS code tooke the .ssh file from C:/Users/Owner/.ssh/config instead of 
			Ubuntu/home/striker/.ssh/config
			So for now, I have to copy all of the files from ubuntu over to the C:/users/owner
