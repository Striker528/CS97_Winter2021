Laboratory B: Exploring nonlinear development histories
There is a copy of some version of the GNU Emacs git repository's master branch on SEASnet in the directory ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs.

1. Find the mergepoint M at 7dd52bfd8e503316b4aa9c5767850d3985626b26 (2020-10-17) 
and the commit C at c00606171f88be0df2c19346fa53f401ea71c71f (2020-10-10) 
and describe the relationship between C and M, by drawing a graph containing all paths from C to M.
Your diagram need not list every commit in all the paths, but you should label and list every commit with more than one parent, or with more than one child. 
For example, your graph should have a node labeled C and M because C has multiple childen and M has multiple parents, and the graph’s legend should say that 
C is c00606171f88be0df2c19346fa53f401ea71c71f and that M is 7dd52bfd8e503316b4aa9c5767850d3985626b26.

cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs


git log --graph

git log --graph --pretty=format:"%h %s"

git log --graph --pretty=format:"%h %s" > ~/CS97/Assignment4/outputOfLab1

Line 384 to line 526


Need to look down to up, as the most recent is the top
Start at line 526
	In the second branch, a commit was made (c00606)
Then, next a merge occured at (0ed0da) to join all the commits in the second branch to the first 
Then, from 523 (46c0f) to 403 (e569efb) there are just commits in the first branch 
Next, at 402 (f539ee) a commit occured in the second branch
Then at 400 (2f4505) a merge occured to combined the change at (f539ee) to all the commits in the first branch
Next, 2 more commmits were added to the second branch (2c31ce) and (7d598e)
Then, the second branch broke off to 2 seperate branches, 2a and 2b
2a had a bunch of commits from line 396(ace25f) to 392 (65078)
Then the first branch and 2a were merged at line 390 (3ac3a65)
Next, a commit was added to 2a at line 389 (47b8a1)
Then a merged occured to combine branch 1 and 2a at line 387 (ffd201)
Then a commit occured in branch 2a at line 386 (18c0e20)
Then a merged occured for branch 1 and 2a at line 384 (7dd52b)

So I showed the full process between the 2 commit id's that I was asked. 






2. Clone the GNU Emacs git repository yourself from Savannah, and briefly describe the differences between your repository and the one in ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs. 
(Hint: look at the output of (git branch).)
Put your descriptions into a text file (emacs.txt). Put your diagram into a PDF file (emacs-graph.pdf).

Someone maintins a personal clone, has his own stuff and older personal stuff, no one person can maintian it all. 
Center place has more recent contirbutions (Savannah). 




3. And now for a more open-ended search. The Git 2.30.1 Release Notes (2021-02-08) say 
"Newline characters in the host and path part of git:// URL are now forbidden." 
Which code change or changes actually made this happen, and who authored the change? 
Do not worry about subsequent administrative changes such as merge commits; 
look for the original changes that actually fixed the problem in question. 
Give the SHA1 commit IDs for the relevant changes, and explain how you discovered them, all in a text file (git.txt). 
Also generate patch files for the relevant changes, in (git format-patch) format.


https://giclone https://github.com/git/git/ 

git format-patch -1 <commitID>

git log -S "Newline characters in the host and path part of git:// URL are now forbidden."

git log -S "Newline characters in the host and path part of"
	(To search for the text line that I was asked)

Got 2 commits that matched the text string: d5922333 and e6362826

git show d5922333
- Can't find anything here
- Nothing to follow in this commit. 

git show e6362826
-Has a merge id of 6aed56736b in the comment section about the newline character. 

	git show 6aed56736b
	- note says to go to the previous commit

  		- need to go to previous commit: git show 6aed56736b^
  		git log 6aed56736b^
  		- which is the id a02ea577

    			git show a02ea577
    			- git log a02ea577
			- nothing else to follow here, so I am finished at a02ea577
