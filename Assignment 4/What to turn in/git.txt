3. And now for a more open-ended search. The Git 2.30.1 Release Notes (2021-02-08) say 
"Newline characters in the host and path part of git:// URL are now forbidden." 
Which code change or changes actually made this happen, and who authored the change? 
Do not worry about subsequent administrative changes such as merge commits; 
look for the original changes that actually fixed the problem in question. 
Give the SHA1 commit IDs for the relevant changes, and explain how you discovered them, all in a text file (git.txt). 
Also generate patch files for the relevant changes, in (git format-patch) format.

- Nothing to follow in this commit. 

git show e6362826
-Has a merge id of 6aed56736b in the comment section about the newline character. 

	git show 6aed56736b

  		- need to go to previous commit: git show 6aed56736b^
  		git log 6aed56736b^
  		- which is the id a02ea577
