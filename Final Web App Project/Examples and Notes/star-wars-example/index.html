  <!--Browsers can only perform a CREATE operation if they send POST request to the server. 
    This POST request can be triggered through JavaScript or through a <form> element.

    Let’s figure out how to use a <form> element to create new entries for this Star Wars quote application for now. 
        We’ll examine how to send requests via JavaScript later.

    To send a POST request through a <form>, you need to add the <form> element to your index.html file.

    You need three things on this form element:
        1. An action attribute
        2. A method attribute
        3. name attributes on each <input> elements within the form. -->
  <form action="/events" method="POST">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Day" name="Day">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Month" name="Month">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Year" name="Year">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Time" name="Time">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Address" name="Address">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Description" name="Description">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>

  <!--The method tells browsers what kind of request to send. 
        In this case, we use POST because we’re sending a POST request.

    The action attribute tells the browser where to send the POST request. 
        In this case, we’re send the POST request to /events. -->
